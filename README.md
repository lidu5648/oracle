Project to parse text from several plays (Agamemnon, Romeo & Juliet, Hamlet, and the Importance of Being Earnest) and provide a random line or all lines said by a selected character on a website by making requests to a server.

Progress: done parsing character lines in each text file, currently working on up server requests from website to database of characters.
